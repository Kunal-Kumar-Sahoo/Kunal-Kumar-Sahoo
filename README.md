### 🚀 What I'm Working On

I am currently a PhD student exploring the intersection of **Deep Reinforcement Learning, Physics, and Robotics**. My core research focuses on bridging the gap between abstract AI reasoning and physical common sense.

I am actively building and looking for collaborators on projects involving:
* **Physically-Grounded Reasoning:** Teaching foundation models to understand causal world models through exploration].
* **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models:** Integrating multimodal inputs for robotic manipulation.
* **Physics-Informed Neural Networks:** Embedding physical laws into deep learning architectures for better sample efficiency.

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

I focus on tools that enable **scalable simulation** and **real-world deployment**.

### 🤝 Collaboration & Research Interests

I am always open to discussing ideas or collaborating on papers/code in the following areas:

* **Sim-to-Real Transfer:** How to effectively transfer policies trained in **MuJoCo/Isaac Gym** to real hardware like the **Franka Emika Panda** or **Hello Stretch 3**.
* **Edge Intelligence:** Optimizing DNN training and inference on edge devices (Jetson Nano/Orin) — see my work on *Pagoda* and *Fulcrum*.
* **Multi-Agent Systems:** Experience with traffic control optimization using MARL.

> **Note to Contributors:** If you are working on **World Models** or **VLA architectures**, I would love to connect and compare notes!

### 💬 Let's Chat About...

While I love code, I believe the best ideas come from interdisciplinary discussions. Hit me up if you want to talk about:
* **Philosophy of Mind:** Connectionism, Embodiment, and Reasoning.
* **CS Education:** How we teach complex AI concepts (I have experience mentoring and teaching).
* **The Future of Robotics:** From rigid manipulators to soft robotics and human-robot teaming.
